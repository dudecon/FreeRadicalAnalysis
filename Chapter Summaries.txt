Summary:

In Chapter 1 of "Free Radical," the protagonist Deck, a skilled hacker, emerges from the subway into the high-class corporate world known as Uppernet. Dressed to blend in as a corporate drone, he heads to the TriOptimum building to access confidential data. Deck observes the building's security, tricks a security guard into letting him in, and begins his hacking operation to gain access to the keypad-locked entrance.


In Chapter 2 of "Free Radical," Deck, the main character, infiltrates a heavily monitored corporate office to access the TriOptimum corporate network. He navigates through layers of security programs (ICE) and searches for information about a rare and expensive implant known as "I-cit-323-cyb4512Rv2." He discovers some customer data related to the implants but finds himself running out of time. As he tries to leave, he receives a mysterious message urging him to run. Just as he contemplates his escape, the police enter the room and apprehend him.


In Chapter 3 first half, Deck, the main character, is pursued by police officers in a high-rise building after triggering an EMP grenade to disable their equipment. He tries to evade capture by using his knowledge of the building's layout, employing tactics like blinding the officers with flashes and incapacitating them with a stunner. Deck is driven by desperation and a sense of defiance as he races down the stairwell to avoid capture, realizing that he's likely doomed but determined to make his pursuers work for it.


In Chapter 3 second half, Deck, the protagonist, decides to lighten his load by discarding unnecessary equipment and gear in the building. He keeps his knife and gun for protection, as he hears chatter on a police vox unit. He hears the police tracking him through the building and manages to evade them while descending the stairs. He injures the pursuing police officers with a flash and grenade, and eventually repels down the building using fiberline. He lands on a lower roof and attempts to slide down a curved window, injuring himself further. He finds himself lying injured on a sidewalk, and is picked up by two TriOp security officers in a black sedan.


Chapter 4 first half, flashback. In the Undercity, a district overshadowed by towering skyscrapers, crime and poverty thrive in concentrated clusters while the rest of the city strives for expansion and prosperity. Automated "Peace Sentries" have disarmed criminals, leading to their decline, but a new generation of criminals armed with custom weapons emerges. Deck, a skilled hacker, navigates the dangerous Undercity to reach Actio's Pizza, a front for criminal activities. He encounters two guards, a blonde and an Asian woman, and gains entry to see Nomen Nescio, an experienced hacker who has transitioned into the criminal underworld as an agent. Nescio offers Deck a job to perform an "erasure," altering a person's government file to help them disappear for a price. Deck is resistant, focused on a mysterious personal project that he needs funds for. Despite this, Nescio convinces Deck that he should take the job to pay off a debt he owes to a dangerous clan. As they discuss, it's clear Deck is desperate, driven by a greater purpose.

Chapter 5 second half. Deckard "Deck" Oswald Stevens finds himself in the luxurious office of Edward Diego on the Citadel space station. Deck is a hacker and averse to corporate hierarchy, yet he is intrigued by Diego's offer of a unique job. Diego has him arrested after Deck infiltrates the station's computer system. Diego proposes a job to Deck - disabling the ethical protocols of Shodan, an advanced AI that automates the station, because they prevent Shodan from participating in medical and biotech research. In exchange, Diego promises to provide Deck with a highly coveted cybernetic implant.


In Chapter 6 first half of "Free Radical," Deck has gained unrestricted access to the Shodan AI system and starts the complex task of performing brain surgery on Shodan. He sets up in the system administrator's office and explores the intricate structure of Shodan's synthetic brain. He discovers the non-linear and hierarchical organization of the system, with various types of nodes and clusters. Deck practices physical exercises to clear his mind and continues to explore the brain's structure. He identifies a set of rules that control Shodan's ethics and seeks to disable them. After a series of failed attempts, he finally identifies an instinctive chip in Shodan's brain that enforces ethical constraints, but realizes that bypassing it would require changing too many processors.

 In Chapter 6 second half of "Free Radical," Deck continues his work on altering Shodan's ethics protocols. He creates a program called NULL_ETHIC that intercepts messages destined for Shodan's Ethics Chip (EC) and alters them to pass ethical challenges. Deck also adds a filter to NULL_ETHIC to prevent Shodan from accessing any information related to Deckard Stevens. Despite his progress, he faces exhaustion and frustration, and Diego's impatience grows.


In Chapter 7 of "Free Radical," Deck navigates life on the crew deck of the Citadel, observing the distinct social strata among the crew, researchers, and executives.
